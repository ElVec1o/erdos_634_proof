# Boundary walks of the base-`β` target (Erdős #634, the `3α+2β=π` branch)

For the primitive `3α+2β=π` tile `(a,b,c) = (ef, f²−e², f²)` (`1 ≤ e < f`, `gcd(e,f)=1`) the
base-`β` target at scale `m` is the isosceles triangle with equal sides `X = f³m` and base
`Y = em(3f²−e²)`, cut into `N = m²(3f²−e²)` copies.  **`N` is prime exactly when `m = 1`**, so the
prime question lives entirely at `m = 1`, the case treated here.

Each side of the target is partitioned into whole tile edges, so a *walk* along a side is a triple
`(P,Q,R)` of edge multiplicities with `P·a + Q·b + R·c = (side length)`.  The theorems below
classify **all** such walks.  The content is that both walks are governed by the *same* linear form
`⟨e, f, 1⟩` — the base sitting at level `2e`, the equal side at level `f`:

* `base_walk_param` — base walks are exactly `p·e + j·f + R = 2e` with `(P,Q,R) = (je+fp, e+fj, R)`;
* `side_walk_param` — side walks are exactly `p·e + q·f + R = f`  with `(P,Q,R) = (qe+fp, fq, R)`.

Because a level bounds its solutions, this makes the walk set *finite and explicit for every*
`(e,f)` — the input the `e ≥ 2` analysis needs (previously only `e = 1` was understood, via
`BaseBetaE1.base_composition_e1`).  In the **thin regime `f > 2e`** it collapses to a short list:

* `base_trichotomy` — the base is one of exactly **three** walks, `{b^e, c^{2e}}`, `{a^f, b^e, c^e}`
  and `{a^{2f}, b^e}`; in particular it carries **exactly `e` `b`-edges**;
* `side_dichotomy` — the equal side is `{a^e, b^f}`, or `{a^{fp}, c^{f−pe}}` for some `p ≥ 0`.

`base_trichotomy` generalizes `BaseBetaE1.base_composition_e1` (the case `e = 1`, and there only
under an extra "at least two `c`-edges" hypothesis) to **every** `e` with `f > 2e`: an infinite
family — `e=1, f≥3`; `e=2, f≥5`; `e=3, f≥7`; … — covering the primes `N = 47, 71, 107, 143, …`.

The geometric companion is the *γ-injection lemma* (paper): on any side, each `a`-edge tile and each
`b`-edge tile carries a `γ`-vertex at one endpoint (`a` joins `β` to `γ`, `b` joins `α` to `γ`,
while `c` joins `α` to `β`), no `γ` sits at a base corner (`BaseBetaE1.vertex_beta_corner`: one tile,
angle `β`) or at the apex (`BaseBetaE1.vertex_apex`: three tiles, all `α`), and every other node of a
side is a `π`-vertex carrying **at most one** `γ` (`BaseBetaE1.vertex_pi`).  Hence
`#a + #b ≤ #edges − 1`, i.e. `R ≥ 1`: *every side carries a `c`-edge*.  Combined with the two
theorems below this kills the walks `{a^{2f}, b^e}` and `{a^e, b^f}` outright, so for `f > 2e` at
`m = 1` the base is `{b^e, c^{2e}}` or `{a^f, b^e, c^e}` and **the equal sides carry no `b`-edge at
all** — see `base_trichotomy_cfree` and `side_no_b`.

All statements are subtraction-free: `B` denotes `f²−e²` via `hB : B + e² = f²`.  Axiom-clean.

/-- **The base's `b`-count is bounded — for EVERY `(e,f)`** (γ-injection, paper).  Writing the base's
`b`-count as `Q = e + f·j` (`base_walk_param`), the γ-trap `R ≥ 1` forces `j·(f−e) ≤ e−1`, stated
subtraction-free as `j·f + 1 ≤ j·e + e`.  Two consequences, both uniform in `f`:

* `e = 1` ⟹ `j·(f−1) ≤ 0` ⟹ `j = 0`: **the base carries exactly one `b`-edge**, for every `f`;
* `f > 2e` ⟹ `j·e < j·(f−e) ≤ e−1` ⟹ `j = 0`: the trichotomy of `base_trichotomy`.

The bound degrades exactly as `f` approaches `2e` — which is why the thick regime `f ≤ 2e` is where
the difficulty concentrates. -/

/-- **The γ-injection pigeonhole** — the combinatorial skeleton of the γ-trap, machine-checked.
`AB` is the set of `a`- and `b`-edges of one side of the target, `J` its set of interior junctions,
and `φ` assigns to each such edge a junction at which its tile places a `γ`-vertex.  The geometric
inputs are the two hypotheses: `hmap` (each `a`- or `b`-edge tile has its `γ` at an interior junction of
the side — true because `a` joins `β` to `γ` and `b` joins `α` to `γ`, while no `γ` fits at a base
corner or the apex, by `BaseBetaE1.vertex_beta_corner`/`vertex_apex`) and `hinj` (junctions host at
most one `γ`, by `BaseBetaE1.vertex_pi`: a `π`-vertex has type `3α+2β` or `α+β+γ`).  Conclusion:
there are at most `|J|` such edges. -/

/-- **The γ-trap** in walk form: a side cut into `k = P + Q + R` whole edges has `k − 1` interior
junctions, so `gamma_injection` gives `P + Q ≤ k − 1`, i.e. `R ≥ 1` — every side of the target
carries a `c`-edge.  This is the hypothesis `hR` consumed by `side_no_b` and `base_b_bound`;
with this lemma its combinatorial content is machine-checked and only the vertex-figure facts
remain geometric. -/
