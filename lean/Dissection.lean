# The geometric layer: dissections of a triangle

Every other Lean file in this development is arithmetic or combinatorial: it takes the geometry as
*hypotheses* (`gamma_injection`, `cancellation_core`, `vertex_pi`, …).  This file begins the layer
that is supposed to **supply** those hypotheses — i.e. the step "a tiling exists ⟹ these equations
hold", which until now rested entirely on the written proofs in the paper.

Mathlib has no theory of dissections (no `IsTiling`, no planar subdivision, no Jordan curve theorem,
no Euler formula, no polytopes — verified by source survey), so everything here is built from the
convexity and measure-theory primitives that *do* exist.

## What is defined

* `Tri` — a nondegenerate closed triangle in the plane, carried by its three vertices together with
  affine independence.  Its point set is `Tri.carrier = convexHull ℝ (range pts)`.
* `Dissection N` — **G1**: a target triangle, `N` tiles, the covering equation, and pairwise
  disjointness of tile *interiors*.  This is the faithful minimal definition: "disjoint interiors
  covering `T`" is stated combinatorially (`Disjoint (interior _) (interior _)` and a set equation),
  *not* measure-theoretically, so that it is provable-with; the measure-theoretic consequence is
  derived below rather than assumed.

## What is proved (no `sorry`, no new axioms)

* `Tri.volume_pos`, `Tri.volume_ne_top` — a nondegenerate tile has positive finite area.  The route
  is affine independence ⟹ `affineSpan = ⊤` ⟹ nonempty interior ⟹ positive Haar measure.
* `Dissection.aedisjoint` — **the bridge from "disjoint interiors" to "a.e. disjoint"**.  This is
  where `Convex.addHaar_frontier` (a convex set has null frontier) does the real work: it is the
  reason a tiling may be non-edge-to-edge and the area count still holds.
* `Dissection.volume_target` — **the area identity** `|T| = Σ |tᵢ|`.
* `Dissection.volume_target_of_congruent` — for equal-area tiles, `|T| = N · |t|`, i.e. `N` is
  determined by the target and the tile.
* `Dissection.pos` — a dissection has at least one tile.
* `cornerAngle_sum` — the three interior angles of a tile sum to `π` (from Mathlib's
  `angle_add_angle_add_angle_eq_pi`).
* `angle_indep`, `vertex_multiplicities`, and the three corollaries
  `vertex_pi_multiplicities`, `vertex_beta_corner_multiplicities`, `vertex_apex_multiplicities` —
  **the arithmetic half of G5**, which converts a *real* angle equation at a vertex into the
  *integer* multiplicity equations that `BaseBetaE1.vertex_pi`, `vertex_beta_corner` and
  `vertex_apex` currently take as hypotheses.  These corollaries produce those hypotheses in exactly
  the form those theorems consume, so that half of the vertex-figure classification is no longer
  assumed.

## What is NOT proved, and is taken as an explicit hypothesis

Following the discipline of `BaseBetaWalks.gamma_injection` and `InvariantCore.cancellation_core`,
the facts this file cannot yet derive are isolated as named `Prop`-valued predicates in the final
section (`HasAngleSums`, `HasEdgeChains`, `InteriorBalanced`), each with a docstring saying exactly
what it asserts and why it is not available.  They are *definitions*, not axioms: nothing in this
file assumes them, and any downstream theorem that needs one must take it as a hypothesis.

The single sharpest gap: Mathlib has the triangle angle sum but has **no** statement that the angles
around an interior point sum to `2π`, and no machinery (no sectors, no angular measure, no winding
number) to build one.  See `HasAngleSums`.

## Compile status

Every Mathlib lemma invoked below was verified to exist, with its exact signature and argument
order, by reading the source of the pinned revision (Lean 4.30.0 / Mathlib v4.30.0 — the same
revision this project already builds against).  The file has **not** been compiled.  Four steps are
tactic-level guesses rather than verified applications and should be checked first if it fails:

1. `Tri.affineSpan_eq_top` — the closing `by simp` must discharge `Fintype.card (Fin 3) = 2 + 1`.
   Fallback: `by simp [Fintype.card_fin, finrank_euclideanSpace]` or `by norm_num`.
2. `Dissection.volume_target` — the anonymous pairwise lambda is elaborated against
   `Set.Pairwise ↑univ (AEDisjoint volume on _)`, which requires unfolding `Set.Pairwise` and
   `Function.onFun`.  Fallback: state it as a separate `have` with explicit `∀ i ∈ _, ∀ j ∈ _, …`
   binders (defeq ignores binder annotation, so that form is accepted).
3. `Dissection.volume_target_of_congruent` — the closing `simp [hv]`.
   Fallback: `simp only [hv, Finset.sum_const, Finset.card_univ, Fintype.card_fin, nsmul_eq_mul]`.
4. `cornerAngle_sum` — the three `angle_comm` rewrites are order-sensitive.  The three rewritten
   terms are checked by hand to be exactly the three summands of `key`; if `rw` misfires, use
   `simp only [EuclideanGeometry.angle_comm]` plus `linarith`, or `omega`-free `linarith` on a
   restated `key`.

The remaining proofs are either single verified lemma applications or `omega`/`linear_combination`
on hand-checked algebraic identities.

Axiom-clean apart from the usual `propext`, `Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound`.

/-! ## The vertex-figure bridge (arithmetic half of G5)

`BaseBetaE1.vertex_pi`, `vertex_beta_corner` and `vertex_apex` are stated for *given integer
multiplicities* satisfying two linear equations.  The step from a *real* vertex figure to those
integers was, until now, entirely on paper.  It has two halves:

* the geometric half — a vertex figure of the dissection yields naturals `x, y, z` with
  `x·α + y·β + z·γ` equal to `2π`, `π`, or a corner angle.  **Not available** (see `HasAngleSums`).
* the arithmetic half — from such a real equation, together with `3α+2β = π` and `α ∉ ℚπ`, the two
  integer equations follow.  **That is what is proved here**, and it is unconditional.

The mechanism: `α` and `π` are linearly independent over `ℚ` (that is exactly the irrationality
hypothesis), so a relation `A·α + B·π = 0` with integer `A, B` forces `A = B = 0`. -/

/-- **ℚ-linear independence of `α` and `π`.**  If `α` is not a rational multiple of `π`, an integral
relation `A·α + B·π = 0` is trivial.  (Same mechanism as `BaseBetaE1.direction_free`.) -/

`3α + 2β = π` and `α ∉ ℚπ` (both supplied by `BaseBetaE1.tile_alpha_irrational` for every tile of
the family).  If a vertex figure consists of `x` copies of `α`, `y` of `β` and `z` of `γ`, and the
total is `s·α + t·β`, then the multiplicities satisfy `x + 2z = s` and `y + z = t`.

Eliminating `β = (π − 3α)/2` turns the real equation into `A·α + B·π = 0` with
`A = 2(x+2z−s) − 3(y+z−t)` and `B = y+z−t`; `angle_indep` kills both. -/

/-! ## What is still assumed

The following are `Prop`-valued **definitions**, not axioms.  Nothing above uses them.  They name,
precisely, the geometric facts the paper still supplies by hand, so that a downstream theorem can
take one as an explicit hypothesis — the discipline of `BaseBetaWalks.gamma_injection` and
`InvariantCore.cancellation_core`. -/

/-- **G2 — the angle sums.**  `angleAt D v i` is intended to be the angle the `i`-th tile subtends
at the point `v` (zero if `v` is not on the tile).  `HasAngleSums` asserts the three classical
statements: the tile angles at a point interior to the target sum to `2π`; at a point interior to a
side of the target they sum to `π`; at a corner of the target they sum to that corner's angle.

**Status: research-level in Lean.**  Mathlib has the triangle angle sum
(`EuclideanGeometry.angle_add_angle_add_angle_eq_pi`) and the on-a-line splitting
(`angle_add_angle_eq_pi_of_angle_eq_pi`), and it has free *mod 2π* additivity for oriented angles
(`Orientation.oangle_add`).  It has **nothing** that lifts a mod-2π sum to a real-valued one beyond
two summands (`Real.Angle.toReal_add_eq_toReal_add_toReal`), and no sectors, no angular measure and
no winding number.  Distinguishing `2π` from `4π` for an `n`-fold fan must be built from scratch. -/
def HasAngleSums {N : ℕ} (D : Dissection N) (angleAt : Plane → Fin N → ℝ) : Prop :=
  (∀ v ∈ interior D.target.carrier, ∑ i, angleAt v i = 2 * Real.pi) ∧
  (∀ v ∈ frontier D.target.carrier, v ∉ Set.range D.target.pts →
    ∑ i, angleAt v i = Real.pi) ∧
  (∀ k : Fin 3, ∑ i, angleAt (D.target.pts k) i
    = cornerAngle (D.target.pts (k + 1)) (D.target.pts k) (D.target.pts (k + 2)))

/-- **G3 — the chain lemma.**  No vertex of the dissection lies in the relative interior of a tile
edge unless that edge is collinear with it; consequently each side of the target, and each maximal
interior segment, is partitioned into whole tile edges, and the far side of any segment is met by a
chain of whole edges.  Stated here as: the set of tile vertices meeting a segment `S` cuts `S` into
sub-segments each of which is a union of whole tile edges.

**Status: hard but not research-level** — it is a finite combinatorial statement about a finite
point configuration, but it needs a usable notion of "edge of a tile" and of "maximal segment",
neither of which Mathlib provides.  This is the input to `BaseBetaWalks`' walk equations
`P·a + Q·b + R·c = (side length)`. -/
def HasEdgeChains {N : ℕ} (D : Dissection N) (edgeOf : Fin N → Fin 3 → Set Plane) : Prop :=
  ∀ (S : Set Plane), S ⊆ frontier D.target.carrier →
    ∃ (part : Finset (Fin N × Fin 3)), (⋃ e ∈ part, edgeOf e.1 e.2) = S

/-- **G4 — the cancellation input.**  For a direction `d`, `Lint d` is the total directed length of
interior tile-edges in direction `d`.  `InteriorBalanced` asserts `Lint (d + π) = Lint d`, i.e. each
interior segment is covered exactly once from each side.

**Status: this is precisely the hypothesis `hLint` of `InvariantCore.cancellation_core`**, which is
already machine-checked to imply the Cancellation lemma.  Supplying it is the remaining geometric
content: it is where non-edge-to-edge incidences are absorbed (the two sides of a segment may
subdivide it differently, but each covers it once because the tiles cover the target with disjoint
interiors — the same fact `Dissection.aedisjoint` uses, but in a *length* rather than *area* form,
which is why it does not follow from the area work above). -/
